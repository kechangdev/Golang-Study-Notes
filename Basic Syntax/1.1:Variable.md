Declare:

```golang
var name datatype
```

For example, if we want to declare a integer which named a with value 10, in that case, we should write:

```golang
var a int
a = 10
```

Or:

```golang
a := 10
```

Moreover, we can init multiple variables:

```golang
var a, b int
```

Or: 

```golang
var (
   a int
   b int
)
```

Or:

```golang
a, b := 1, 2
```
